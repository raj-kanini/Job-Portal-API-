## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following prerequisites:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the .NET Core SDK installed.
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or another relational database.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a similar tool for testing API endpoints.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-api-project.git
   cd your-api-project
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

## Configuration

1. Configure the database connection in the `appsettings.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "YourConnectionStringHere"
     },
     // Other settings...
   }
   ```

2. Update any other configuration settings such as authentication or external service integrations in the `appsettings.json` file.

## Running the Application

1. Build and run the application from within your IDE.

2. The API will be hosted at `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`. You can access it via a web browser, but most interactions will happen through HTTP requests.

## API Endpoints

- Provide a detailed description of your API endpoints and their functionality here.

## Testing

1. Use Postman or a similar tool to test your API endpoints.
2. Alternatively, you can use Swagger UI to interact with and test your API. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI by navigating to https://localhost:5001/swagger (or http://localhost:5000/swagger). Swagger UI provides a user-friendly interface for exploring your API endpoints, making requests, and viewing responses. It's a handy tool for both testing and documenting your API.

Including Swagger UI in your testing process can be especially useful, as it allows you to quickly understand the available endpoints and test them without leaving the documentation environment.
